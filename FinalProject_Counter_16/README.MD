## Lab Description
The goal of this lab is to build a DC-to-DC Charge Pump regulator. The charge
pump should output 2V and drive a 2 MÎ© resistor.

## NAND2
First begin with the 2-input NAND gate. All gates will use 6u/2u MOSFTES.

### NAND2 Schematic
Create the schematic and an icon that resembles a 2-input NAND.

### NAND2 Layout
Next create the layout, as shown below.

### NAND2 Simulation
Simulate the gate to ensure that it works properly. Apply all four inputs (00,01,10,11).

## NOT
Next create a NOT gate. Again use 6u/2u MOSFETS.

### NOT Schematic
The schematic consists of only one NMOS and one PMOS.

### NOT Layout
The layout will look like the one below.

### NOT Simulation
Again simulate the gate using both inputs (0,1).

## Ring Oscillator
The ring oscillator will utilize the NAND and NOT gates.

### Ring Oscillator Schematic
Connect an even number of NOT gates in series with a NAND gate. One input of the NAND is the enable, the other is the feedback from the NOT gates.

## Ring Oscillator Simulation
Simulate the oscillator to ensure the signals are oscillating and out of phase of eachother.

## 3 Stage Charge Pump
The charge pump will allow our voltage to increase from 1V to 2V. 

### Stage Charge Pump Schematic
Utilize the 2 oscillating signals as inputs to charge the capacitors.

### Stage Charge Pump Simulation
Simulate the charge pump to ensure that the output reaches 2V.

## Regulator
The regulator will control the voltage so it is not higher than 2V. 

### Regulator Schematic
The regulator will utilize two of the NOT gates.

### Regulator Simulation
Simulate the regulator to ensure the enable output is high when the voltage is below 2V. My Regulator cuts off at 1V.

## DC to DC Charge Pump
Now the DC-to-DC Charge Pump will utilize all of the above.

### DC to DC Charge Pump Schematic
Combine the Ring Oscillator, Charge Pump, and Regulator to creat the DC-to-DC Charge Pump.

### DC to DC Charge Pump Simulation
Simulate to see if it is working properly. My regulator is not working properly so the DC-toDC- Charge Pump is not working.
